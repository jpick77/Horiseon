# Code Refactor Starter Code

# Description

My objective was to make this code look clean and opperate properly. I refactored the code into Semantic HTML.
I also added "alt" tags to every picture to make sure there was a description of the picture incase there was a problem loading the image.
I forgot to take a screenshot of the code before. So I only have the screenshot of the final code.
By using Semantic tags I was able to clean up the code to the liking of the requirments.

# Installation
